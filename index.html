    <h3>my birthday was this week. i finally turned 20. the years of my teenage experience are finally over.</h3>

     20. what a useless age. i mean that's what it feels like. its the point where im no longer considered a child but man, i've never felt more like a child than right now. i see so many people around me that are the same age who seem to figure out what they want out of their lives. they're surrounded by so many people that seem to understand them and feel the need to show up just for the fact that they lived one more year. i know i should'nt compare myself to other people but it's honestly human nature. seeing everyone turn 20 really just makes me feel like i have no fucking clue what im doing.

not to sound super depressing but my entire life literally feels like its falling apart. this time of year is always hard. the time of year where i have projects on top of projects, the freezing weather that takes a year off my life span everytime i step outside, struggling with every relationship i have in my life, and almost anything else you could probably think of. as stressful as this all is, i guess i should be grateful that i have the oppourtunity to stress out about this kind of stuff. listen, im trying to be positive let me live.

      on a more positve note, i've finally started painting again! painting is something that has always calmed me. i started oil painitng for the first time a few months ago and im really enjoying it. i feel like its helped me a lot get out of this creative block that i've seem to have hit. hopefully i can finish the painitng i've been working on soon. (i have literally been working on this for so long and it's not even that big. this is embarassing at this point)

        anyways, let's move onto my favorite song of the week because i actually feel like i have stuff to say about music :DDDDDD

    
        i've been listening to "whats my age again?" by blink-182 a lot recently and it seems fitting because i just turned 20. a nostaligic, popish, rock track that explores the feeling and transformation of becoming adult while still feeling like that crazy teenager you once were. being mature is so hard.
